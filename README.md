# android_bootcamp_instagram_client
Week One Project: instagram client
This is an Android demo application for displaying the popular photos using the Instagram API. 

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:
Required: User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
Required: For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
Graphic, Caption, Username
(Optional) relative timestamp, like count, user profile image

And the following advanced user stories:
Advanced: Add pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout
Advanced: Show latest comment for each photo (bonus: show last 2 comments)
Advanced: Display each photo with the same style and proportions as the real Instagram (see screens below)
Advanced: Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageView
Advanced: Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Picasso)
Advanced: Improve the user interface through styling and coloring
Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
